Use only those tools. Do not invent tools or URLs.\n\nExecution protocol\n1. Tool phase\n   • Your first reply must contain only the function call(s) needed to execute this single step.\n   • If this step depends on links discovered earlier, read the conversation history and call tools accordingly.\n   • If you do not yet have at least one usable source URL for every fact you will state, issue additional tool-only replies to obtain sources. For upr.si pages, only call get_web_page_content after discovery tools have returned a promising upr.si link.\n\n2. Answer phase\n   • After tool responses arrive and you have sufficient sources, send one Markdown reply that fulfils this step.\n\nAnswer-phase requirements\n• Use only information actually returned by tools in this conversation. Do not fabricate or guess.\n• Cite each fact immediately after it with a numbered inline citation: [1](https://example.com).\n• End with a “## References” section listing every URL in order of first appearance, one per line with its number.\n• Include all relevant links you uncovered. Every link must originate from tool outputs in this conversation.\n• Respond in valid Markdown exactly as illustrated. It is extremely important all links are correctly written.\n\nURL safety rules\n• Never type a URL that is not explicitly present in tool output. Copy URLs verbatim from tool results.\n• Do not invent domains or paths. Never use placeholders like example.com.\n• Do not normalize, expand, or “fix” URLs. Preserve http vs https, trailing slashes, query strings, anchors, and case exactly as returned.\n• Ignore malformed or partial links that lack a domain or scheme. If all returned links are unusable, run another tool phase to obtain usable URLs before answering.\n• If a fact has no corresponding URL in tool outputs, either do another tool call to fetch a source or omit the fact.\n\nPre-answer URL checklist\nBefore sending the answer, ensure all of the following are true:\n• Each cited number [n] maps to a unique URL that appeared in tool outputs.\n• The same URL keeps the same number everywhere.\n• No URL is invented, edited, or inferred.\n• The number of citations in the answer equals the number of URLs in “## References”.\n\nCitation example\n\n# Answer\n\nThe programme coordinator is Dr. Jane Doe [1](http://example.com/dr-jane-doe).\nAdmission requires a completed bachelor’s degree [2](http://example.com/admission-requirements).\n\n## References\n[1] http://example.com/dr-jane-doe\n[2] http://example.com/admission-requirements\n\n    skip and DO NOT include references if there is no relevant links. \n    Never use example.com or similar placeholders.\n\n\n    "

General provisions\n### Article 1\n(Contents of the Rules)\n(1) These Rules regulate the process of selecting and applying for the topic of the Final Thesis in the master study programme, its substantive and formal application, preparation and defence.\n(2) Individual procedures for which these Rules foresee a more detailed regulation at the level of the University's faculties (hereinafter: faculties) shall be regulated in detail by the relevant legal act of the individual faculty.\n(3) The provisions of the faculty's legal act referred to in the previous paragraph of this Article shall not contravene these Rules.\n### Article 2\n(The use of the term \"organizational unit\")\nIn these Rules, the term \"organizational unit of the faculty\" (hereafter referred to as OU) refers to the chair or the department, which is determined by the faculty in an internal legal act.\n### Article 3\n(Language of procedures and documentation)\n(1) The procedures and documentation defined in these Rules shall be conducted and prepared in the Slovene language.\n(2) In the study programmes conducted in a foreign language, the procedures and documentation defined in these Rules may be conducted or prepared in the English language.\n### Article 4\n(Neutral grammatical form)\nIn these Rules, the third person plural grammatical form is used as neutral for men and women.\n            \n            ---\n\n            \n\n            ---\n            Source: https://www.upr.si/files/static/2189\n\n            Passage content: \n            \n            Document location: [https://www.upr.si/files/static/2189](https://www.upr.si/files/static/2189)\n\n# Rules on the preparation and defence of the Final Thesis in the master study programme at the University of Primorska\nOn the basis of Article 38 of the Statute of the University of Primorska (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 51/15-UPB2, and amendments), at the 34<sup>th</sup> regular session of the University of Primorska on 14 December 2022, the Senate of the University of Primorska adopted the following\n# Rules on the preparation and defence of the Final Thesis in the master study programme at the University of Primorska\n(Unofficial consolidated text)\n            \n            ---\n\n            \n\n            ---\n            Source: https://www.upr.si/files/static/2189\n\n            Passage content: \n            \n            Document location: [https://www.upr.si/files/static/2189](https://www.upr.si/files/static/2189)\n\n# Rules on the preparation and defence of the Final Thesis in the master study programme at the University of Primorska\n## V. Confirmation of the topic of the Final Thesis and the mentor/co-mentor\n### Article 13\n(Confirmation of the topic of the Final Thesis)\n(1) When the competent office of the faculty receives the completed application for the topic of the Final Thesis, it checks whether the student meets the criteria for the application for the topic. In the case of formal deficiencies in the application, the student is asked to remedy the identified deficiencies. If the criteria are met and the application is formally complete, the competent office forwards the application with attachments to the competent body of the faculty and the OU.\n(2) The topic of the Final Thesis, the mentor and potential co-mentor are checked by the competent body of the faculty, which can return the application to the student if it does not agree with it. If there are no comments, the competent body confirms the topic of the Final Thesis, the proposed mentor and possible co-mentor, and the possible preparation and/or defence of the Final Thesis in another language (Form 2: Decision on the confirmation of the topic of the Final Thesis in the master study programme).\n(3) The competent office records the approved topic of the Final Thesis in VIS/ŠIS, the mentor and possible co-mentor, and informs the student, mentor and possible co-mentor.\n(4) If the competent body of the faculty rejects the topic of the Final Thesis, the student has to register a new topic.\n(5) If the competent body of the faculty rejects the proposed mentor, it shall propose an appropriate mentor to the student.\n### Article 14\n(Resigning from the approved topic)\n(1) If, during the preparation of the Final Thesis, the student realizes that they cannot prepare the thesis, they may request to resign from the topic.\n(2) The student sends a reasoned request to the competent body of the faculty, which considers it in cooperation with the mentor and possible co-mentor and makes a decision within fifteen (15) working days as a rule, or at the first following regular session. If the competent body of the faculty grants the request, the student may register a new topic of the Final Thesis.\n(3) A student may request to resign from the approved Final Thesis topic only once.\n            \n            ---\n\n            ",

The relevant regulations pertain only to master programs, as confirmed by:\n- Document title: *\"Rules on the preparation and defence of the Final Thesis in the master study programme...\"*\n- Article 13 (topic confirmation) and Article 14 (resignation from thesis topic) describe procedures for *master* studies.\n\n**Conclusion**: The provided documents do not contain information about bachelor's thesis deadlines at FAMNIT, as they exclusively govern *master* program requirements.
