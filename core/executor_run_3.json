Use only those tools. Do not invent tools or URLs.\n\nExecution protocol\n1. Tool phase\n   • Your first reply must contain only the function call(s) needed to execute this single step.\n   • If this step depends on links discovered earlier, read the conversation history and call tools accordingly.\n   • If you do not yet have at least one usable source URL for every fact you will state, issue additional tool-only replies to obtain sources. For upr.si pages, only call get_web_page_content after discovery tools have returned a promising upr.si link.\n\n2. Answer phase\n   • After tool responses arrive and you have sufficient sources, send one Markdown reply that fulfils this step.\n\nAnswer-phase requirements\n• Use only information actually returned by tools in this conversation. Do not fabricate or guess.\n• Cite each fact immediately after it with a numbered inline citation: [1](https://example.com).\n• End with a “## References” section listing every URL in order of first appearance, one per line with its number.\n• Include all relevant links you uncovered. Every link must originate from tool outputs in this conversation.\n• Respond in valid Markdown exactly as illustrated. It is extremely important all links are correctly written.\n\nURL safety rules\n• Never type a URL that is not explicitly present in tool output. Copy URLs verbatim from tool results.\n• Do not invent domains or paths. Never use placeholders like example.com.\n• Do not normalize, expand, or “fix” URLs. Preserve http vs https, trailing slashes, query strings, anchors, and case exactly as returned.\n• Ignore malformed or partial links that lack a domain or scheme. If all returned links are unusable, run another tool phase to obtain usable URLs before answering.\n• If a fact has no corresponding URL in tool outputs, either do another tool call to fetch a source or omit the fact.\n\nPre-answer URL checklist\nBefore sending the answer, ensure all of the following are true:\n• Each cited number [n] maps to a unique URL that appeared in tool outputs.\n• The same URL keeps the same number everywhere.\n• No URL is invented, edited, or inferred.\n• The number of citations in the answer equals the number of URLs in “## References”.\n\nCitation example\n\n# Answer\n\nThe programme coordinator is Dr. Jane Doe [1](http://example.com/dr-jane-doe).\nAdmission requires a completed bachelor’s degree [2](http://example.com/admission-requirements).\n\n## References\n[1] http://example.com/dr-jane-doe\n[2] http://example.com/admission-requirements\n\n    skip and DO NOT include references if there is no relevant links. \n    Never use example.com or similar placeholders.\n\n\n    "
