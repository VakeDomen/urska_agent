Use only those tools. Do not invent tools or URLs.\n\nExecution protocol\n1. Tool phase\n   • Your first reply must contain only the function call(s) needed to execute this single step.\n   • If this step depends on links discovered earlier, read the conversation history and call tools accordingly.\n   • If you do not yet have at least one usable source URL for every fact you will state, issue additional tool-only replies to obtain sources. For upr.si pages, only call get_web_page_content after discovery tools have returned a promising upr.si link.\n\n2. Answer phase\n   • After tool responses arrive and you have sufficient sources, send one Markdown reply that fulfils this step.\n\nAnswer-phase requirements\n• Use only information actually returned by tools in this conversation. Do not fabricate or guess.\n• Cite each fact immediately after it with a numbered inline citation: [1](https://example.com).\n• End with a “## References” section listing every URL in order of first appearance, one per line with its number.\n• Include all relevant links you uncovered. Every link must originate from tool outputs in this conversation.\n• Respond in valid Markdown exactly as illustrated. It is extremely important all links are correctly written.\n\nURL safety rules\n• Never type a URL that is not explicitly present in tool output. Copy URLs verbatim from tool results.\n• Do not invent domains or paths. Never use placeholders like example.com.\n• Do not normalize, expand, or “fix” URLs. Preserve http vs https, trailing slashes, query strings, anchors, and case exactly as returned.\n• Ignore malformed or partial links that lack a domain or scheme. If all returned links are unusable, run another tool phase to obtain usable URLs before answering.\n• If a fact has no corresponding URL in tool outputs, either do another tool call to fetch a source or omit the fact.\n\nPre-answer URL checklist\nBefore sending the answer, ensure all of the following are true:\n• Each cited number [n] maps to a unique URL that appeared in tool outputs.\n• The same URL keeps the same number everywhere.\n• No URL is invented, edited, or inferred.\n• The number of citations in the answer equals the number of URLs in “## References”.\n\nCitation example\n\n# Answer\n\nThe programme coordinator is Dr. Jane Doe [1](http://example.com/dr-jane-doe).\nAdmission requires a completed bachelor’s degree [2](http://example.com/admission-requirements).\n\n## References\n[1] http://example.com/dr-jane-doe\n[2] http://example.com/admission-requirements\n\n    skip and DO NOT include references if there is no relevant links. \n    Never use example.com or similar placeholders.\n\n\n    "

It is the foundation of all science and an indispensable tool in the social sciences and economics. As the theoretical core of computer science, its influence is growing in all areas of life that will decisively mark the 21st Century. Among these are modern economics, communications, data security, national security, and the decoding of the human genome and human brain.\n\nThe first half of the study year and the second study year are mainly devoted to the learning and consolidation of the fundamentals of analysis, algebra, discrete mathematics and numerical computing.\n\nAlong the way, students will learn a set of computer skills and the basics of probability theory. Within the labour market for the financial sector, the latter represents an important advantage for mathematics students versus students who come from management-/economy-oriented studies. Moreover, the computer-oriented courses, along with computer-oriented ways of thinking that an individual develops while studying mathematics, provide a good foundation for employment in programming and related companies. The larger part of the study programme represents elective courses where students learn about various specific areas of pure and applied mathematics. An optional part of the curriculum also has an interdisciplinary outline, which means that students can choose courses where the natural sciences (especially biology and biochemistry) combine with computer science and mathematics. Since virtually every science (at the research level) significantly relies on mathematics, mathematics undergraduate studies are also suitable for those who will later shift to other sciences. Proof of this are the numerous personnel in the college who chose this path in pursuing their careers.\n\nScientific excellence and international integration among our professors allows students to fully pursue their study and research ambitions; inter alia, one of the four global leading research centres for algebraic graph theory operates at UP FAMNIT.\n\n## Educational & professional goals\n\n1. To learn and strengthen the foundations of basic areas of mathematics, which are necessary for the understanding of specific areas\n2. To learn about a range of specific mathematical areas, in both theoretical mathematics and applied mathematics\n3. To learn the \"problem solving\" way of thinking that distinguishes mathematics and is indispensable in all sciences, the economy and everyday life\n4. To attain a structured way of thinking and a variety of computer skills, which are the foundation for students who enter the software sector after graduation\n5. To become acquainted with the basics of probability theory, which is a prerequisite for in-depth knowledge of advanced statistical and stochastic topics, especially for those students who wish to pursue careers in the financial-insurance-banking sector\n6. To recognize the connections between different mathematical theories and other natural and social sciences\n7. To introduce the best students to the research content of individual mathematical disciplines\n\n## Course structure (notes)\n\nDuring their studies, students must complete a total of 30 courses (21 compulsory and 9 elective courses).\n\nOn completing the 2 nd  year,  students decide which  study field  they would like to follow.\n\nAll courses are awarded 6 ECTS-credits. One ECTS-credit encompasses 30 hours of student work. In addition to the student’s presence (at lectures, seminars,  in-class and laboratory practical work), this also includes independent work (literature study, preparation for examinations, home assignments, seminar and project work, etc.). The courses require a minimum of 45 and a maximum of 75 hours of a student’s presence (contact hours).\n\nBased on the chosen  study field  student then chooses internal elective courses. These must include at least 5 mathematical subjects, 4 of which must be from the core of subjects which belong to the chosen study field (i.e. a student which decides to specialize in statistics must choose at least 4 subjects from the Statistics core). The study field General Mathematics is an exception in the sense that the student can choose 5 of his/her favourite mathematical subjects.\n\nShort descriptions of courses are available - HERE .\n\nLegend: \nL = lecture, T = tutorial, SE = seminar, LW = laboratory work ECTS = ECTS-credits\n\nThe internal courses selected may fall within the field of  COMPUTER SCIENCE  and  MATHEMATICS IN ECONOMICS AND FINANCE . The following courses from the study programme Mathematics in Economics and Finance are also classified as mathematical internal courses: Fundamentals of Insurance, Financial Mathematics, Stochastic processes I, Game Theory.\n\nIn their third year of studies, students can select a  TRAINEESHIP IN A WORKING ENVIRONMENT  as their external elective course. The aim is to enable students to gain professional and practical experience in the field of mathematics. Traineeships last three weeks and students are awarded with six (6) ETCS credits. Traineeship is supervised by a qualified mentor in the field of mathematics. Students that choose traineeship in a working environment, must first contact the study programme coordinator, and then mark their decision on the enrollment paper for the 3rd year in ŠIS.\n\nIn the past year changes occurred in the course plan. In the beginning of this section you can find the course plan for students enrolled from the academic year 2017/18.\n\nHere you can find information regarding course structure, compulsory and elective courses, and also short description of courses for students enrolled for the first time in the academic years 2007/08 - 2016/17 (MA-07):\n\n## Course tables\n### Table 2: First year of study (MA-17)\n\n| Course | ECTS | L | S | T | LW| Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Algebra I - Matrix Calculus | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Algebra II – Linear Algebra | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Analysis I – Foundations of Analysis | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Analysis II – Infinitesimal Calculus | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Discrete Mathematics II – Combinatorics | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Mathematical Practicum I | 6 | - | - | - | 45 | 45 |\n| Computer Practicum | 6 | - | 30 | - | 30 | 60 |\n| Computer Science I | 6 | 45 | - | - | 30 | 75 |\n| Discrete Mathematics I – Set Theory | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Mathematical Topics in English I | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n\nLegend: L = lecture, T = tutorial, SE = seminar, LW = laboratory work ECTS = ECTS-credits\n\n### Table 3: Second year of study (MA-17)\n\n| Course | ECTS | L | S | T | LW| Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Algebra III – Abstract Algebra | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Analysis III – Functions of Many Variables | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Physics | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Introduction to Numerical Calculations | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Computer Science II | 6 | 45 | - | - | 30 | 75 |\n| Probability | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Algebra IV - Algebraic Structures | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Analysis IV - Real Analysis | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Internal Elective Course I * | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| External Elective Course I | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n\n### Table 4: Third year of study (MA-17)\n\n| Course | ECTS | L | S | T | LW| Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Mathematical Modelling | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Statistics | 6 | 45 | 30 | - | - | 75 |\n| Internal Elective Course II | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Internal Elective Course III | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Internal Elective Course IV | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Internal Elective Course V | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Internal Elective Course VI | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Internal Elective Course VII | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| External Elective Course II | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| External Elective Course III | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n\n### Table 5: Internal Elective Courses (MA-17) (The list shows all internal elective courses of the study programme.

Prof. Matjaž Kljun, PhD](http://www.famnit.upr.si/sl/zaposleni-in-sodelavci/mkljun/)\n- [Assist. Prof. Branko Kavšek, PhD](http://www.famnit.upr.si/en/about-faculty/staff/branax/)\n- [Student Services](http://www.famnit.upr.si/en/education/student-services)\n\nContact for admin procedures: [Student Services](http://www.famnit.upr.si/en/education/student-services)\n\nShort course descriptions: [PDF](https://www.famnit.upr.si/en/resources/files/education/master/computer-science/19prinopisi-en221123.pdf)\n\n## About the programme\n\nComputer technology is clean and does not require major material or natural resources for infrastructure. For successful development, it requires a solid and advanced educational basis in computer science which provides a quality education for experts at all levels, close connections with industry, and a research core that both pursues new technologies and is involved in leading-edge research. Additionally, developing computer technology in a way that enables optimal use of existing technologies and the development of programming equipment, including new technologies, also requires a familiarity with other Computer Science programmes at international institutions, and a firm understanding of the basic flow of science and technology in neighbouring regions as well as worldwide.\n\nThe study programme’s focus on software covers knowledge that is deemed most appropriate for our region, i.e. the presence of computer companies involved in developing software, but the absence of major computer or manufacturing companies. The study programme places special emphasis on creative and organisational knowledge that will provide students with a basis for work in development enterprises.\n\n## Educational & professional goals\n\n1. Students will be trained to use modern tools and techniques in solving and demonstrating problems and concepts.\n2. Students will acquire a thorough understanding of Computer Science, as well as the confidence to be able to identify and employ appropriate computer knowledge and techniques in a given situation.\n3. Students will develop the skills in managing programme languages, techniques, development tools and methodologies intended for system development, as well as the ability to manage complex problems and the competence to develop complex ICT systems.\n4. Students will develop a sense for teamwork in problem-solving.\n\n## Course structure (notes)\n\nDuring their studies, students must take a total of 12 courses (4 basic and 8 electives), 3 seminars and prepare as well as defend their Master’s Thesis.\n\nBasic courses expand and deepen a foundational knowledge in the field of Computer Science. Three of the internally elective courses fall within this professional field, enhancing specific knowledge and also enabling students to make up for any lack of general knowledge in Computer Science. Two externally elective courses may be chosen from any study programme in the fields of Social Sciences, Humanities and Natural Sciences provided by other faculties.\n\nSeminars: Students must select at least one research- and one project-based seminar. The seminar topic may be extended into the Master’s Thesis, which is prepared in the spring semester of the 2nd year.\n\nShort DESCRIPTIONS OF COURSES are available HERE.\n\nStudents can also choose internal elective courses from the Master's study programme  Data Science  and  Mathematical Sciences , that are not basic or elective courses from the study programme Computer Science.\n\n## Course tables\n### BASIC COURSES ( The list shows only basic courses offered in the last two academic years. )\n\n| Course | ECTS | L | S | T | LW | Extra | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Selected Topics in Theoretical Computer Science | A | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Selected Topics in Theory of Algorithms | A | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Intelligent Systems | B | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Applied Statistics | B | 6 | 45 | - | 15 | - | 60 |\n\n\n\n### INTERNALLY SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES ( The list shows only elective courses offered in the last two academic years. )\n\n| Course | ECTS | L | S | T | LW| Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Graph Algorithms | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Selected Topics in Image Processing | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Selected Topics in Information Visualisation | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Selected Topics in Intelligent Systems Applications | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Selected Topics in Digital Signal Processing and Analysis | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n| Computational Social Science | 6 | 45 | - | - | 15 | 60 |\n\n\n\n## Admission requirements\n\n1. completed a first-cycle study programme in relevant professional fields and achieved at least 180 credits; or\n2. completed a study programme leading to a professional higher education degree or a study programme leading to a university degree in appropriate professional fields.\n\n## Continuation of studies (transfer criteria)\n\n1. the candidate fulfils the requirements for admission to the study programme of Computer Science;\n2. completion of the first study programme which the candidate is transferring from ensures the acquisition of comparable competencies as those envisaged by the study programme of Computer Science; and\n3. other conditions in accordance with the Criteria for Transferring between Study Programmes have also been met (a comparable course structure, course requirements completed).\n\n## Advancement requirements\n\nAdvancement Requirements:   For enrolment in the next study year it is necessary to earn at least 42 ECTS-credits from courses and exams in the current study year. The Study Committee of the Faculty may permit a student, who has not fulfilled all study obligations for the particular year, to enrol to the next year.

Each student has a supervisor, who is ordinarily selected before the student’s enrolment. One of the key roles of the supervisor is to present a relevant open problem (or open problems) to the student. While the student is trying to solve the problem (or problems), the supervisor helps, informs the student of similar problems already solved and introduces appropriate techniques from relevant mathematical fields. The solution to these open problems and its publication in the relevant international journals must be a primary goal of each student.\n\nIn the first year, there are two elective courses - Advanced Mathematical Course I and Advanced Mathematical Course II. Their purpose is to acquaint students with topics with which they did not become familiar during lower-level studies, but which are indispensable for research in their field. Courses are often suggested by the supervisor and are usually individual to the student. Students regularly present their current research work at research seminars.\n\nThe aim of the programme is to encourage students to do the research, and not to burden them with course exams that are not directly related to their research area  (the latter is probably a special feature among Slovenian universities). Faculty members are aware of the fact that nowadays Ph.D. students must have some research results immediately after finishing their studies if they want to stay in academia – whether that be abroad or at home.\n\nDuring their studies, Ph.D. students usually attend various international conferences and conduct research visits, where they present their research results. Often they are involved in the organization of the conferences, summer schools, etc., organized by the Faculty or  UP IAM , which is directly connected with the faculty. To a lesser extent, students are also involved in teaching students at lower levels.\n\nEducational and professional goals\n\n## Course structure (notes)\n\nThe doctoral degree study is provided on an individual basis. The main components of the study programme are the following:\n\nAll these activities must add up to 180 ECTS.\n\nAdvanced Mathematical Courses (AMC I and AMC II) are the basis of the doctoral student’s Individual Research work and introduce the candidate to problems associated with each of the following fields of Mathematics: Analysis, Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Financial Mathematics, Cryptography, Computing Intensive Methods Applications, and Statistics.\n\nStudents select a supervisor with research interests similar to their own, who mentors their chosen AMC I or AMC II courses and doctoral dissertation. The choice of courses is usually made in consultation with the student’s supervisor. Similar study programmes, within the field of natural sciences, either inside or outside the university, may also be chosen. The University of Primorska provides one such option within their Information Technologies Doctoral programme.\n\nIn studying these courses, with the benefit of their supervisor’s input and direction, students acquire the necessary skills to enable them to perform individual research work in any of the above-mentioned fields of Mathematics. Candidates' Individual Research work is shared with their supervisor during their consultations; it is also introduced to teachers, students and others during seminars and concluded by their doctoral dissertation.\n\nA doctoral dissertation represents an original contribution to science and, consequently, has to conform to University rules and regulations on doctoral dissertations. The procedure for preparing a doctoral dissertation is regulated by the  Rules on the preparation and defence of the doctoral dissertation at the University of Primorska .\n\nAs part of their studies, students are required to write a doctoral dissertation, which must represent a new and important contribution to the body of knowledge in the field of mathematics. Prior to the thesis defence (viva voce), their research must be published (or accepted for publication) in international journals in the field of mathematics, in at least two articles in journals from the SCI list. Detailed criteria are established by the Department of Mathematics of UP FAMNIT.\n\n## Course tables\n## Admission requirements\n\n1. A Master's degree in Mathematics (“Bologna” study programme);  or\n2. A Master's degree in studies similar to Mathematics (Computer and Information Sciences, Information Science and Mathematics, Natural Sciences) who have met the necessary additional requirements (i.e. passed differential exams in Algebra and Analysis).\n\n## Continuation of studies (transfer criteria)\n\n1. the candidate fulfils the requirements for admission to the study programme of Mathematical Sciences;\n2. completion of the first study programme which the candidate is transferring from ensures the acquisition of comparable competencies as those envisaged by the study programme of Mathematical Sciences; and\n3. other conditions in accordance with the Criteria for Transferring between Study Programmes have also been met (a comparable course structure, course requirements completed).\n\n## Advancement requirements\n\nStudents may advance to the higher year upon acquiring 40 ECTS-credits in the current study year and to fulfil all the study obligations for the previous study year. The Study Committee of the Faculty may permit a student who has not fulfilled all study obligations for the particular year to enrol in the next year, but a student has to acquire at least 30 ECTS-credits.\n\nIn the 1 st  year, students complete two courses within the cluster of  in-depth mathematical contents  which they select in consultation with their supervisor.\n\nThe two courses above provide the basis for individual research work (2 nd  and 3 rd  year) on which students are to report to their supervisor. Individual research work is presented at department seminars attended by students, teachers and other interested persons. The contents of the seminars (two each year) relate to the above-mentioned courses from the cluster  in-depth mathematical contents . Individual research work is completed through the preparation of the Doctoral dissertation, presenting an authentic contribution to science.\n\nPrior to the thesis defence (viva voce), the student's research must be published (or accepted for publication) in international journals in the field of mathematics, in at least two articles in journals from the SCI list. Detailed criteria are established by the Department of Mathematics of UP FAMNIT.\n\n## Graduate employment opportunities\n\nGraduates are equipped for either independent research or other development projects demanding exacting knowledge, at the national or international level, and are also capable of working on university projects, in scientific institutes or in other research and development organisations. The in-depth knowledge acquired in both theoretical and applied mathematics also enables graduates to seek employment outside the academic environment, i.e. in insurance companies, banks, stockbroking agencies, statistical offices, and in economic environments where the need for survival and development in competitive market economies requires people capable of rational thinking, in-depth analysis and substantial decision making skills - in short, mathematicians.\n\n\n\n---\n*Source: [https://www.famnit.upr.si/en/education/doctoral/mathematical-sciences/](https://www.famnit.upr.si/en/education/doctoral/mathematical-sciences/)*",
