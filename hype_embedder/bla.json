Students may select elective courses from study programmes provided by other institutions of higher education in Slovenia and internationally. The courses selected may fall within the study of Biopsychology - Natural Sciences, Psychology, Medicine, Sociology, Pedagogy, Social Work etc. \n\nIn the chapter Course Structure you can only find the elective courses that are offered in the last two academic years. The list of all elective courses is available in the chapter Course Structure - short description of courses. \n\nEvery academic year, the Faculty offers a different selection of elective courses from the internal elective courses listed. The Faculty tries to meet student interests within the limits of the Faculty’s resources. The final selection of elective courses for the next academic year is published in July. The coordinator will help guide students when choosing their elective courses.",
